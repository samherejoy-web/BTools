Database Connection Tests - PostgreSQL connection established, all tables (users, blogs, tools, categories, reviews) exist and accessible, data retrieval working from all major tables. API Endpoint Tests - Health check confirms database connectivity, categories/tools/blogs endpoints functional with proper data structure. PostgreSQL-Specific Tests - JSON columns working correctly (tools.features as JSON arrays, blogs.tags as JSON arrays, blogs.json_ld as JSON objects), UUID primary keys valid format, foreign key relationships intact (blog-author, tool-category), complex queries with joins successful. Performance Tests - Connection pooling configured with pool size 20, rapid API calls (5 calls in 0.32 seconds) demonstrate good performance. Migration Verification - Seed data properly loaded (8 users including superadmin/admin/user roles, 6 categories, 6 tools, 3 published blogs), published blogs accessible with correct status and timestamps."
