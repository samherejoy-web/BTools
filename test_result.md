        comment: "🐛 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Review submission has a frontend-backend mismatch. Backend endpoint POST /api/tools/{tool_id}/reviews requires 'tool_id' in request body (ReviewCreate model), but frontend was sending requests without tool_id in body. This causes 422 validation error: 'Field required'. The backend logic is correct, but frontend needs to include tool_id in request payload."

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW SUBMISSION TESTING COMPLETED: 1) Created test user and authenticated successfully 2) Tested exact frontend-backend mismatch scenario - confirmed 422 error when tool_id missing from request body 3) Verified backend correctly validates ReviewCreate model requiring tool_id field 4) Successfully submitted reviews when tool_id included in request body 5) Tested slug vs ID scenarios - backend only accepts tool_id in URL path, not slug 6) Authentication middleware working correctly - proper JWT token validation 7) Review creation logic working perfectly - updates tool rating and review count 8) Backend logs show clear 422 validation errors for missing tool_id and 200 success when properly formatted. CONCLUSION: Backend implementation is correct and working. Issue was frontend not including tool_id in request body, which has been identified and can be fixed by adding tool_id to the request payload."
