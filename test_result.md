Backend endpoint POST /api/tools/{tool_id}/reviews requires 'tool_id' in request body (ReviewCreate model), but frontend was sending requests without tool_id in body. This causes 422 validation error: 'Field required'. The backend logic is correct, but frontend needs to include tool_id in request payload."

CONCLUSION: Backend implementation is correct and working. Issue was frontend not including tool_id in request body, which has been identified and can be fixed by adding tool_id to the request payload."
